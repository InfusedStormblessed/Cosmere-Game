This file is where I will show you differences between the previous and nearest versions, including planned one. As of now, they are:
Adding lore (the story of the books{WILL LIKELY CONTAIN SPOILERS}
Minor bug and funcionality fixes.
Removed EXP bar due to other bugs/glitches being caused by it
Next update includes but is not limited to:
More special moves per character
A new book, most likely Mistborn Era Two
